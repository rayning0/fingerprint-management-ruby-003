> The IAFIS maintains the largest biometric database in the world, containing the fingerprints and corresponding criminal history information for more than 47 million subjects in the Criminal Master File. 
> The fingerprints and corresponding criminal history information are submitted voluntarily by state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies. 
> 
> Commercial Applications 
> The two Tables on the right of the Data Model show commercial applications of Biometrics and fingerprinting, where individuals can be tracked as they move through an environment or building with many fingerprinting scanning machines.
